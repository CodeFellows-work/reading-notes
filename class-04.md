# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout # 
## Links ## 
There are several ways to use links within HTML. There is a method to link to another website, a method to link to another page that is part of the same website, a method to link to a part on the same page, a method to open up a new browser, and a method to start up your email program and send an email to someone. 

### Linking To other Websites ### 
What you must first understand is the beginning part of a link. The beginning part of a link will use the `<a>` element followed by an `href` to make the link. Here is an example: 

      <a href=""... 
   
As mentioned in previous notes, the <a> element or tag is called the anchor tag. So to link to another website you will need the full address of the website you want to link to. This is called an **absolute URL**. This is an example: 
  
  <a href="githiub.com"> Text you want to make a link </a> 

### Linking To Another Page On The Same Website ### 
To link to another page on the same website - and an example for this can be like a contact page, or an about us page, you you can use what is called a **relative URL**. Makes sense because the main page is like a parent page, and the other webpages you want to link to which are on your same website can be like child pages. An example for this link can be simply your webpage address that you created. 

<a href="myexamplewebsite.html"> Text you want </a>
