# Component Based UI

### Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)

The five JavaScript frameworks other than React that I have chosen to list are: 

1. Angular.js - used for building single-page client applications
2. Vue.js - used for building single-page applications and user interfaces
3. Ember.js - utilizes a component service pattern and allows developers to create scalable single-page applications
4. Meteor - allows for rapid protyping and produces cross-platform code
5. Mithril - used for building single-page applications


### Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?

To start off, both a framework and a library are used by developers as solutions to common problems. Both frameworks and libraries are filled with reusable code that will make life simpler for the developer. Developers will often interchange the term "framework" and library", but there is a difference between the two. A good example of how to distinguish the two comes from an article on FreeCodeCamp. Essentially, how they diffrentiate the two, is that you can think of a library as if you already have a home and just need some help with some furniture. So you go to Ikea and pick and choose what you want inside of your home. On the other hand, a framework can be though of as if you do not have a home yet, but you have the blueprints (which are limited in design) to build your home
and you do not have much say unless the contractor asks for your input. The framework is in control.

## _Term_

### Rendering
The processing of written code, and then displaying your written code. 
### Templates
"The <template> HTML element is a mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a page is loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript.
Think of a template as a content fragment that is being stored for subsequent use in the document. While the parser does process the contents of the <template> element while loading the page, it does so only to ensure that those contents are valid; the element's contents are not rendered, however."

### State
State in terms of React.js can be defined as something that will determine how a component is going to be rendered. A quick consideration when determining what state really is - is to think about tempreture and water. Because tempreture is defined with a value, it is quite possible to change the value. So if you have water in freezing conditions, the tempreture is at the very most 32 degree F. The waters' state is frozen due to a value change. The same concept applies when you are turning the ice, into bioling water. You are changing the state using a value. 
the components in React is the water, and the tempreture is like the state that will change from component to component.
