# AWS: Cloud Servers

### Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
The `Web-Request-Response-Cycle` is a flow of data or communication between clients and servers. From your desktop and in your browser you are the client. Once you type in the website you want to search or do anything on the browser for that matter, the browser or client will try and make a request out to the service or servers. The servers will then communicate back to your browser or the client with the information that was requested. This is called the response.

### Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
The server is essentially a service that will communicate back to the client - sending a response with the data that was requested. A server relates to the WRRC becasue it is the Response portion of the WRRC. 

### What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

"Software deployment refers to the process of running an application on a server or device. A software update or application may be deployed to a test server, a testing machine, or into the live environment, and it may be deployed several times during the development process to verify its proper functioning and check for errors. Another example of software deployment could be when a user downloads a mobile application from the App Store and installs it onto their mobile device."

A service that will provide a response back to the client once data has been requested. It is the Response in the WRRC. 

### Pub/Sub
"Pub/Sub enables you to create systems of event producers and consumers, called publishers and subscribers. Publishers communicate with subscribers asynchronously by broadcasting events, rather than by synchronous remote procedure calls (RPCs)." -[Source](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview)
### WRRC
WRRC stands for *Web-Request-Response-Cycle* which includes a client making a request and the server making a response.
