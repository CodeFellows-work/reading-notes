### Why is the Context API useful?

Context API is very useful because you can set and use functions globally. This is really handy so that you can have multiple levels of state. State that can run locally without passing anything in, as well as potentially setting state or using a function from the context within a different component - all while still managing local state within that component. 

### Can a component outside of a provider get its context?

A component outside of the provider will not have access to the context. only the `props.children` will have access. 


### What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
Common use cases for using Context is to have authorization within your application where the state variables for the authorization is living at top level.

### Describe “Context Hell”

Context hell is like the callback hell, when you have multiple nested contexts.
