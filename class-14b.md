# What Google Learned # 
Furthering the article written by The New York Times, Charles Duhigg - Julia Rozovsky, ultimatley found an opportunity at Google after gaining a lot of experience with teams. This was good timing for her because "the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more’’ over the last two decades and that, at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employee’s day is spent communicating with colleagues." - Harvard Business Review. 

At Google, even the top brass believe that only putting the best working people within a group would be the most productive, and diversly grouping all the introverts in one group. Abeer Dubey, from Google, also adds that people work together best if teams are friends outside of work as well. 

One thing Julia Rozovsky found, was when working in a group the personal norms and traditions are overridden by the norms and traditions of the group itself. This meant that how you would act individually s overidden by the personality of the group, or the culture of the group.
