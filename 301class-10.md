## [Understanding the JavaScript Callstack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/) ## 

### What is a ‘call’? ###
A call is essentially a function invocation. 

### How many ‘calls’ can happen at once? ###
A call stack or a bunch functions from top to bottom, is synchronous. Meaning that the `calls` occur one at a time from top to bottom. This is a good thing to understand when incorporating an asyncronous pattern. 

### What does LIFO mean? ###
LIFO or *Last In First Out*. This essentially is when you have a call stack, and if you push a function into the stack, and it is the last function in the stack - it will be the fiurst one out of the stack after it has been called.

### What causes a Stack Overflow? What is a ‘refrence error’? ###
A stack overflow will occur when there is a recursive function, or a function that calls itself. When a function is added onto the stack many times, the browser will accomodate what it can hold, but eventually it will throw an error saying that the stack is over filled.

### What is a ‘syntax error’? ###
A syntax error is like the grammatical errors you have when writing sentences. It is when the language cannot parse the code you have written - "in terms of syntax" 

### What is a ‘range error’? ###
A range error occurs if you are using a range for any of your code, and the range is invalid. 

### What is a ‘type error’? ###

A type error essentially is if you can not access the data type you are trying to access. Can be most commonly seen like this: 

      Cannot read property 'example' of undefined
      
### What is a breakpoint? ###

a break point is a point in which your code will stop running, and allow you to check the values at that point. 
### What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code? ###
The word `debugger ` in JavaScript will stop the execution of your code and call a debugger function.
