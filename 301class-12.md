# Mongo and Mongoose # 
### Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases: ### 

SQL | NoSQL 
-----|------
Table based database | Document based database
SQL have predefined schemas | Databases are the collectrion of things that do no have schema definitions
SQL databases are vertically scalable | NoSQL is horizontally scalable
Structured Query Language | Unstructured Query Language
Relational Database | Non-relational database 


### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
For an SQL Database, a good fit is table based data. Also, "SQL databases are best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications, as it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data.", therefore it is also a good fit for "the complex query intensive environment" - [Source](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

### Give a real world example.
An example of heavy duty transactional applications being used can be within a grocery store sale data. 

### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
"NoSQL databases can be classified on the basis of way of storing data as graph databases, key-value store databases, document store databases, column store database and XML databases." - [Source](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

### Give a real world example.
An example of its usage could be to keep track of statistics. 

### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
The NoSql is best fit for hierarchial data due to the key value storing. 
### Which type of database is best for scalability?
Overal I think that the NoSql would be the best fit for scalability, firstlt, both SQL and NoSQL have scalibility compatibilty - just one is vertically and the other is horzontally. To increase load on SQL you will just need to update the CPU,RAM,SSD,etc, for each server, where as the NoSQL requires simply adding servers.  

### What does SQL stand for?
#SQL# stands for Structured Query Language  
### What is a realational database?
Relational databases have a structure that will allow for access in relation to other data in the database.  
### What type of structure does a relational database work with?
A relational database works with data organized in tables.  
### What is a ‘schema’?
Schema is a collection of data objets. 
### What is a NoSQL database?
If SQL is relational, NoSQL databases are unrelational. 
### How does it work?
Because of the different types of data that was forming due to the decreasing costs of storage, NoSQL was formed to be able to handle the different types of data.  This was achieved through allowing for more unstrctured data to be stored.  
### What is inside of a Mongo database?
Mongo has data stored as documents which are then put into collections. A database can have one or more of these collections that have been formed. 
### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
I think that MongoDB is much more flexible, because it is a non-relational database. With Mongo, you will be able to deal with different types of data, as well as easily expand with just an addition of a server. 
### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
* Can't handle high loads and/or complex tranactional applications.
* For some NoSQL databses you must seek community help, with little help due to limitesd exerts.
