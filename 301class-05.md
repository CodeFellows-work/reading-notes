# Putting It All Together # 

### How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy? ### 

When you recieve a mock, you would break that mock down into a component heirarchy by starting off with breaking the mock down into boxes with names. Then create sub-boxes with names from the bigger box. Much like a `<div>` that houses another `<div>`... but in real-life. 

### What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components? ###

The single responsibility principle just states that a component should be focused on one thing - and if it starts to deviate from that or the component becomes large enough, you should start to create sub-components. 

### What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application? ### 

Essentially, when building a `static` application you are creating the frame of your application. This is to essesntially brainstorm as you create and does not take much thinking if you are not implementing any functionalities. It is like typing up an HTML script without the JavaScript yet incorperated. So instead of using state that would update data, you would just use props for now to start to connect each of the components to the parent. 

### Once you have a static application, what do you need to add? ### 

Once you have created your static application, the next step is to create some interactivity. This is achieved when you update your page so you have to start incorperating `state` to make this work. 

### What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state? ### 

1. Does the data change? 
2. Does it get passed as a prop
3. Where does the data change?

### How can you identify where state needs to live? ### 

When there is some data within a component that needs to change, or update - that is when you know you need state in that place.
