# Passing Functions As Props # 

## [React Doc - List and Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html) ##
### What does your `.map()` return? ### 
The `.map()` function returns an things from an array much like the  `forEach` loop, but the `.map()` function will populate the results in a new array - calling the function on every array item. 

### If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React? ### 
In React if you want to loop through an array but display them in JSX, all you need to do is use the  `{}` curley braces. For instance:

        const myArray = [1,2,3,4,5]; 
        
          const mapArray = myArray.map((array) ==> 
              <li>{array}</li> 
            ); 
            
If you look closely, you can see that I looped through my myArray which is full of numbers, with the `.map()` function, and then planted them inside of the list elements using the curley braces. I just displayed values in my array in JSX. What I should also note is that `Each list item needs a unique key`. 
 
### What is the purpose of a key? ### 
I look at `keys` similarly to `id` or `class` attributes, you may see in your basic `html` documents you would use for your CSS. I think `keys` are like that but for React. 

## [The Spread Operator](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab) ## 
### What is the spread operator? ### 
The **spread operator** is a quick useful syntax to modify your array. You can add items to your arrays, combine arrays or objects, and spread out an array into function arguments. 

To combine two arrays: 

          [...iterableObj, '4', 'five', 6]; // combine two arrays by inserting all elements from iterableObj
          
[source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)
 
To add new items into an array: 

      const ocean = ['🐙', '🦀'];
      const fish = ['🐠', '🐟'];

      const aquarium = [...ocean, ...fish];

      aquarium; // ['🐙', '🦀', '🐠', '🐟']

      // Original Array Not Affected
      ocean; //  ['🐙', '🦀']

To combine objects into one: 

      let person = {
          firstName: 'John',
          lastName: 'Doe',
          age: 25,
          ssn: '123-456-2356'
      };


      let job = {
          jobTitle: 'JavaScript Developer',
          location: 'USA'
      };

      let employee = {
         ...person,
         ...job
      };

## [Video - How To Pass Functions Between Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c05OL7XbwXU)

### In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components? ###

In the video the first thing or step that is involved where the developer passes functions between componenets is to create the function wherever the state is that needs to be changed. 

### In your own words, what does the increment function do? ### 

The incremement function will basically increment by one and then return the value. 

### How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component? ### 

Form the parent that has the method, it will be passed to component which will then pass to the child component which will be accessed with the props. 

### How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component? ### 

It will invoke the method through props and the contextual this after it has been passed from the component that is in the parent. 

## Things I Want To Learn More About ##

I think that learning more about the spread operator would be beneficial for the future. I feel that this is an important concept and many things will be accomplished with this operator. I also would like to learn more in depth about passing functions between components with visual aid such as a data flow chart.
