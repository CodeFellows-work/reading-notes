# Component LifeCycle / UseEffect() 

1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

We do not need multiple HTML pages in a React app, because react can utiilize componenets to with the DOM to render different pages. Thus you can easily create single-page applications with React.

2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
 
  a.  Outside the <BrowserRouter/>
  b.  Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />
  c.  Inside a <Route />
  
 I assume that to make a component render on every page, you would place the component inside the <BrowserRouter /> but outside the <Route/>. Because If you place it inside of a <Route /> I feel that it only routes to the page and not with the component. 
 
6. What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested

 When using routing with components and rendering a new route, the router will actually create a new React element from the given component. This also results in the component unmounting and the new component mounting instead. 
 
 
7. What does props.children contain?
 
 props.children contains anything you include between the opening and cloising tags when you create a component.
 
8. How do useState() and this.setState() differ?

when using this.setState(), you will be setting state within a class component. When using useState(), you are utilizing React hooks and you will be setting state within a functional component. 


### _Term_ 
### State Hook
the state hook is a functional component that will let you add React state to functional components - `useState()`

### Mounting and Un-Mounting

React's main job is to match up the DOM to the components that you want rendered to the screen. Mounting, adds nodes to the DOM and unmounting will remove them from the DOM.
