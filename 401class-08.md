#  Review, Research, and Discussion

### When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
Basic authorization is used to simply get a users username and password, while bearer authorization will take the security a step further and utilize token data to reduce security vulnerabilities meaning that the username and password is essentially masked - and a token is used instead which is useful for the endpoints, but not for anything else. 

### What does the JSON Web Token package do?
The JSON web token package will securely transmit data between endpoints as JSON objects with digital signitures that will be verified and trusted. 
"JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed." - [Source](https://jwt.io/introduction). 

### What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
When storing and creating a SECRET, it is best practice to place them in a dotenv file and then ignored for production - so that the SECRET will stay a secret and nobody will be able to tamper with it. 


## _Term_ 
### encryption
Processesing and converting data, into code or what we will see as gibberish so that the data will not be known to the unauthorized.
### token
A token is used to strengthen the authentication process between endpoints. 
### bearer
The bearer is essentially what has posession of a token to gain access. 
### secret
"JWT is created with a secret key and that secret key is private to you which means you will never reveal that to the public or inject inside the JWT token. When you receive a JWT from the client, you can verify that JWT with this that secret key stored on the server." - [Source](https://medium.com/jspoint/so-what-the-heck-is-jwt-or-json-web-token-dca8bcb719a6#:~:text=JWT%20is%20created%20with%20a,key%20stored%20on%20the%20server.)
