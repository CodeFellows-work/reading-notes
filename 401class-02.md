### Describe (in plain English) what Array.map() does ###
"The map() method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order." 
[source](w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_map.asp)

In terms of the array itself when using this method, the `map()` method will create an entirely new array. 

### Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce() does ###
"The reduce() method reduces the array to a single value." and "The return value of the function is stored in an accumulator (result/total)." 
[source](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_reduce.asp) 

### Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result ###
      
      const superagent = require('superagent'); 
      
      superagent 
      .get('https://theURLThatWeAreGetting') 
      

### With normal Promise .then() syntax ###

    const superagent = require('superagent'); 
      
      superagent 
      .get('https://theURLThatWeAreGetting')
      .then(console.log)
      .catch(console.error) 

### Again with async / await syntax ###

      (async () => {
      try {
      const res = await superagent.get('https://theURLThatWeAreGetting'); 
      }
      catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
      } 
    })

### Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student ###
A promise is made up of 3 different states. 
The first state a promise undergoes is the _pending_ state which is "initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected." 
Another state that a promise goes through is the _fulfilled_ state, which just means that the operation was a success. 
Another state that a promise can go through is the error or _rejected_ state. This means that the oepration failed. 

A promise can be any of these states. 

To go through the motions of a promise, you can imagine that the promise will start at its initial state which is the pending state. If the promise is fulfilled, the `.then` will fulfill or the operation will continue to operate and go onto async actions. 
If the promise is rejected, the `.then` or the `.catch` will be used for error handling.

### Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not? ### 

All callbacks are not considered Asynchronous. For instance, there is the `forEach` method that will call a function once per item, as part of a step by step sequential execution. 

"For a function to be asynchronous it needs to perform an asynchronous operation. It needs to incorporate the argument callback in handling the results of this asynchronous operation. Only this way the function becomes asynchronous."
