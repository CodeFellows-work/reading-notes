### What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?

In terms of REST, PUT and PATCH are both for updating. However, the way that the update is done at a location is different. In simple terms, `PUT` updates with entirety. For instance: 

 "When you make a PUT request to ‘https://internet-street.com/plot-1’ with a prefabricated house, you’re saying “Please PUT this house in the location marked as    plot-1”. That instruction searches through our street for the specified location and replaces the content at that location. If nothing is found at the location,    it’ll simply PUT the resource at the location. In this case, a full prefabricated house. Thus, a PUT request always contains a full resource."

 So going off of the example that was quoted above, if a PUT is for bigger updates, a patch is a minor update. For instance, if PUT was used to place the house where it is, PATCH is used to make updates to that house. 
 
 "A PATCH request on the other hand, is used to make changes to part of the resource at a location. That is, it PATCHES the resource — changing its properties. It is used to make minor updates to resources and it’s not required to be idempotent."

### Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
[10 Tools For mocking HTTP requests](https://nordicapis.com/10-tools-to-mock-http-requests/)

From the link above, the first 3 tools that are explained is: 
  1. Nock
  "Nock is an HTTPS library designed to replicate and mock servers and expectations in Node.js. Functionally, Nock does this by overriding both the http.request and http.ClientRequest functions, intercepting requests and responding with a specific mocked response through the use of Interceptors." 
  2. MockServer
  "MockServer (and its counterpart service MockServer Proxy) is a multifaceted tool that comes in a variety of builds. It’s available as a Netty web server, a Docker container, a Maven plugin, an npm plugin, and a Grunt plugin."
  3. Beeceptor
  "Beeceptor is a great tool largely because it requires absolutely no code in order to utilize it. Beeceptor is a free online tool for mocking a REST API interaction using any HTTP request. You can customize your responses to simulate pretty much any response or failure situation." 

### Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
Swagger is a tool kit of open source tools that helps the developer design, build, document and consume REST APIs. Swagger has a browser-based editor, the UI renders OpenAPI specs as interactive API documentation, And the Swagger Codegen generates server stubs and client libraries from OpenApi spec. 
[Source](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/)

APIDoc.js "creates a Documentation HTML page" and you can use "API-Descriptions from your source code". apiDoc specifically supports own created templates, includes histroy, compares old and new API-method versions, Resuse of Documentation parts, extendable, and you can create your own Documentation Methods.
[apiDoc Documentation slide](https://speakerdeck.com/rottmann/api-documentation?slide=3)

With unsuccessful API calls, the HTTP status codes could be any of the following: 

    400 Bad Request         500 Internal Server Error  
    401 Unauthorized 
    403 Forbidden 
    404 Not found 
    409 Conflict 
With Successful API calls, the HTTP status codes could be: 

    200 OK 
    201 Created 
    204 No Content 

### Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
SOAP stands for simple Object Access Protocol and was developed before REST. It gave developers the power to exchange data easily through different platforms and different programming languages. 

REST stands for Representational State Transfer and utilizes the HTTP verbs which we are familiar with: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. 

SOAP | REST 
---- | ----
SOAP is a protocol. SOAP was designed with a specification. It includes a WSDL file which has the required information on what the web service does in addition to the location of the web service. | REST is an Architectural style in which a web service can only be treated as a RESTful service if it follows the constraints of being
1. Client Server
2. Stateless
3. Cacheable
4. Layered System
5. Uniform Interface

# Terms

### Web Server
A web servber is essentially soemthing that will handle a client request. 
[Web Server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server)

### Express
Express is a Node.js web application framework 
[Express](https://expressjs.com/)

### Routing
Routing is essentially a method to route HTTP requests to code 

### WRRC

WRRC is Web Request Response Cycle - which is what happens when the client sends a request to the server and the server responds.

### Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

3 things I had heard about previously is `web server`, `Express`, and `WRRC`.  

### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

I am hoping to learn more about Express, because that seems to be at the center of what we are seeking to accomplish. I am also hoping to learn more about the REST, because that is the main point of how we are going to accomplish tasks thorugh the upcoming labs. Lastly, I would like to understand more of the WRRC, because I think with a firm knowledge of this, itll be easier to accomplish the tasks that need to be done in web development. 

### What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
I am most excited about going more in-depth with REST.
