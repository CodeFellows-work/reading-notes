#  Event Driven Architecture

### Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
"Standard queues guarantee that a message is delivered at least once and duplicates can be introduced into the queue. FIFO queues ensure a message is delivered exactly once and remains available until a consumer processes and deletes it; duplicates are not introduced into the queue." - [Source](https://medium.com/awesome-cloud/aws-difference-between-sqs-standard-and-fifo-first-in-first-out-queues-28d1ea5e153#:~:text=Standard%20queues%20guarantee%20that%20a,not%20introduced%20into%20the%20queue.)

### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

To ensure that a server has recieved a message, you can send a timestamp along and a console log from the servers recieving end. 

### What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

The observer pattern can be a good way to represent an event driven program due ot the one-to-many relationship. "Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically." - [Source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/observer_pattern.htm)

### How do you test an event driven system?

You can test an event driven system through testing to see if an event emit has been called or furthermore, testing to see if any functions have been used after listening or emitting.

### FIFO Queue
"In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed." [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type))
### Pub/Sub
"This document discusses the differences between on-premises message-queue-driven architectures and the cloud-based, event-driven architectures that are implemented on Pub/Sub. Trying to apply on-premises patterns directly to cloud-based technologies, can miss out on the unique value that makes the cloud compelling in the first place." - [Source](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/event-driven-architecture-pubsub)
