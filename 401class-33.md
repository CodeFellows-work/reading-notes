### Describe use cases for useMemo() and useReducer()

A use case for the hook `useMemo()` can be used to return a memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed.

A use case for the hook `useReducer()` is if you want a controlled way to set state so that nothing else can set the state variable without you setting it through the switch cases. 

### Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

Custom hooks are just normal JS functions. You need to use the prefix 'use' so that you can use the functionn and can be reused in other components. 

### What do custom hooks usually do?

Using a custom hook will usually create cleaner functional components, and alloow things to be more reusable. 

### Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications

A custom hook I found that looked really handy is called `useFormState`. All you have to do to get started is `npm i react-use-form-state`. This hook will allow you to set state for all the form inputs you may have using only one hook. The `useFormState` has a structure that looks like this: 

      {
        "values": {
          "name": "Mary Poppins",
          "email": "mary@example.com",
          "password": "1234",
          "plan": "free",
        },
        "validity": {
          "name": true,
          "email": true,
          "password": false,
          "plan": true,
        },
        "touched": {
          "name": true,
          "email": true,
          "password": true,
          "plan": true,
        }
      }

### Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work

A hook that fetches API data might have a place to pass in a link to the desired fetch, and then something that will store that data and allow access to the data through those two arguments. It may look like this: 

        const [linkTOAPI, data] = useCustomHook();

### reducer

"useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks." - [source](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)
