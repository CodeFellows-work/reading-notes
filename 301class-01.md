# Introduction To React And Components # 

## What Is A Component? ## 
A component is a " modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface" - [source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm). The point of a componenet is for the user to easily recognize it definition; and is able to interact with other components. A component is a software object. 

## What Are The Characteristics Of A Component? ## 
As mentioned through [this source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm), there are six main characteristics within a component. 

  * Reusaibility - the same component can be reused in different situations in different applications. Of course there are components that will also be focused for one task 
  * Replaceable - Components can be changed and is not fixed. 
  * Not content specific - Components can be used to operate in different environments and contexts. 
  * Extensible - A component can be extended from its current component to express newer behaviors 
  * Encapsulated - A A component depicts the interface and allows for use of the functionalities when called. This also does not espose detials of any internal details.
  * Independent - Components are designed to have very little to do with other components. 

## What are the advantages of using component based architecture? ## 
There are several advantages of using a component based architecture which includes: 

* Ease of deployment
* Reduced Cost
* Eas of Development 
* Reusable 
* Modification of technical complexity 
* Reliability 
* System maintenance and evolution 
* Independent 

# What Are Props? # 

## What is props short for? ## 
props is another and shorter way of saying properties. This is a special keyword used in React and is mainly used to pass data from component to component. Also, something to note, props are a *read-only* type of data which means that "data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components." - [source](https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0). 

## How are props used in React? ## 
Essentially, props are used in 3 major steps. The first is to define an attribute and its value. Then you pass the prop to the child components. Finally, you render the props Data. 

## What is the flow of props? ##
Props are only passed to components in one-way, which is parent to child.
