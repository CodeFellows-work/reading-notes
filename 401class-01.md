[How To Solve Programming Problems By John Sonmez](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

A common problem that exists, when programmers are going through interview questions is the rush to code. This article further suggests to resist the urge to dive right into code - and start to think through the questions instead. Another suggestion was to keep the code going for a garuanteed solution rather than trying to be fancy with the code.

Steps that Sonmez lays out used for any algorithim type programming problems

    1.  Read the problem completely twice.
    2.  Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
    3.  Optimize the manual steps.
    4.  Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
    5.  Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
    6.  Optimize the real code.

[How To Think Like a Programmer By Richard Reis](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)

The gist of thinking like a programmer,is thinking about more effective methods to solving problems. It is noted that problem-solving skills is actually the best skill to have and employers will like seeing good problem solving skills rather than programing language proficiency. So the first thing to do to think more like a programmer, is to understand exactly what is being asked for - so that you can develope a genuine solution. The next step would be to devise a plan once you have understood what you must accomplish. This important next step is to Divide the problem instead of tackeling the entire problem as a whole. Split it into sub parts. If you happen to get stuck, the best thing to do is take a deep breathe instead of getting frusterated. Reis, notes that the best programmers tend to be more curious than furious when they get stuck. The next step is to just practice. Practicing is something that goes along with everything - the more you do it the more you are familiar with it. So if you constantly problem solve on your own as practice, you can get really good at solving problems.
