## Accessing the web, How it is created, and How it works ## 

Chances are, you have accessed the web in this day and age. Whether it is through a smart device such as a smartphone, or a tablet, or a personal computer - you have accessed the web using a **Web Browser**. 

Now there are multiple **Web Browsers** you can use to access the web. Some of them include: 

* Mozilla Firefox 
* Google Chrome
* Safari
* Opera
* Internet Explorer 

You might have a better idea if you see the logos. The following are logos of the described **Web Browsers** in order:

From a **Web Browser** to go to a **Web Page** you enter a web address or you can just follow a link that may be in bookmarks depending on your browser. 

### So how does a web browser access a web page? 

Each website or page is hosted by a server, better known as a **Web Server**. When you ask your browser to take you to a web page (such as typing or clicking on a link) your browser will send a request accross the internet to the **Web Server**. A **Web Server** is basically a computer that is specifically used to send out web pages to those that request them.
