## Accessing the web, How it is created, and How it works ## 

Chances are, you have accessed the web in this day and age. Whether it is through a smart device such as a smartphone, or a tablet, or a personal computer - you have accessed the web using a **Web Browser**. 

Now there are multiple **Web Browsers** you can use to access the web. Some of them include: 

* Mozilla Firefox 
* Google Chrome
* Safari
* Opera
* Internet Explorer 

You might have a better idea if you see the logos. The following are logos of the described **Web Browsers** in order:

From a **Web Browser** to go to a **Web Page** you enter a web address or you can just follow a link that may be in bookmarks depending on your browser. 

### So How Does a Web Browser Access a Web Page? 

Each website or page is hosted by a server, better known as a **Web Server**. When you ask your browser to take you to a web page (such as typing or clicking on a link) your browser will send a request accross the internet to the **Web Server**. A **Web Server** is basically a computer that is specifically used to send out web pages to those that request them. 

### Screen Readers 

Another method to access the web is for people with visual impairments. Technology has now advanced far enough so that literally anyone can access it. **Screen Readers** is software that will read out the contents of a screen to a user. 

### How is it Created? 

Websites are mainly made up by `HTML` and `CSS` but can also include JavaScript. `HTML` stands for **Hyper-Text Markup Language** and `CSS` stands for **Cascading-Style Sheets**. So within the web pages that you see, your browser will be recieving the `HTML` and `CSS` from a web server and will interpret them into what you see as the web page. With a smaller website, all that is really needed is `HTML` and `CSS` as there is not much that is needed. However, larger more complex web pages might start to utilize other languages to store a data and use databases. 

### How Does This All Work?

As you can see from the picture above The DNS act like telephone books for your device. In order this is how the web works: 

1. You connect to the web through an Internet Service Provider or **ISP** and type in a domain address or web address. For example, github.com 
1. Your computer will connect to servers in the network called DNS or **Domain Name Servers**
1. The DNS will communicate with one another and find the IP address that is associated with the domain name that you requested which was (in our example) github.com. **IP addresses are associated with each domain names and are numbers that are up to 12 digits and sepetrated by periods. Example, 192.168.1.0** 
1. Once the DNS gives your computer a unique IP address, your computer will now be able to contact the web server that holds the web page that was requested. 
1. The web server will then send the web page back to your computer.
