# Forms and JS Events # 
## Forms ## 
Forms on web pages are a good way to get feedback and improve the business operations as a whole. Forms can be used in different ways as well - not just for business needs. For instance, you can use a form to search the web. If your wondering what that means, when you Google things, you are using a form. Your inputting some kind of data that will present you with its findings or in turn an action happens from a result of you enetering information. 
### Form Controls ### 
So, what are the different types of forms you may have encountered? There are a few: 
  * Adding text like your name or password 
  * making choices through use of radio buttons or a checkbox 
  * text area to maybe leave some feadback 
  * a drop down menu for you to choose from 
  * upload files or download files through a button 
  * and finally, the submit button 
### Form Operation ### 
Now, we kind of understand what a form may look like, and maybe even know why its there on a web page. But how do forms actually work? 
1. You start with information. You enter data into a form box - whatever it may ask you. Then you click submit and it sends the data. 
2. that information is sent to a server. 
3. The server will process that information that has been inputted with a hgih-leveled programming language and even can be sent to a database. 
4. Whether the information is stored or processed, you can expect to find another page informing you that the your sata has been submitted. That is the server sending you back another page. 
## Parts of a Form ##
To start off, even a form has structure. You will use a `<form>` tag to indicate that you will use a form. Within the form tag there are attributes that will follow. `<action>` attributes will always follow the <form> tag and is the link that will be the form. So now the code will resemble this: 
  
      <form action ="link to form"
      
But there is another attribute you will use to complete this element. It is the method attribute. The method attribute will have two options. THe "get" and the "post". It is recommended to use the get in the method when you are utilizing smaller forms. The get method will just tack on the values from the form and added to the end of the URL of your form to send to the server. 
The post method is recommended for bigger forms. This method will send to the server the HTTP headers.
### Text Input ### 
A lot of forms will have text input to retrieve from the users. For you to get input you use the `<input>` element to start. Within the <input element you will set the attributes by using `type = "text"` to clarify that you want a text input. Forms are all about values, so you also have a name attribute that it will store. You can also set the size of the text input by using size. Finally you can set how biug the text input would be by using "maxlength". 
Text input is not only for names but passwords. You use the `<type = "password` to define to the form that your entering a pasword. This will turn your text into black dots so that you dont see what your typing. 
How about if you want a text box? And this can be for personal feedback from a user. You use the `<textarea>` element to place a text box. 

### Options ### 
You may have already realized, but a lot of forms on the Internet will also have options for you to choose from. This can be either in a radio button form, which looks like bullet points you can click on, check boxes - which allow you to check each box for a multiple answer input a drop down list box, or a multiple select box. 

This is how all of those look in code: 

Radio Button
      
      <input type="radio" name="sunny" value = "value sent to server for chosen option" checked = "checked" /> 

Chckboxes 
    
      <input type="checkbox" name="sunny" value="value sent to server" chcecked="checked"/> 
      
Drop Down List box 

    <select name ="the category for the box"> 
        <option value="an option for that category> The option </option> 
        ...
     </select> 
     
Multiple Select Box 

    <select name="category" /> 
      <multiple="multiple options">
        <option value ='an option for that category'>The option</option> 
        </select> 
        
### More on <input> ### 
With the `<input>` element you can also make an input box. This is used so that users can upload files. This input can be seen a lot in educational web pages, for you to perhaps turn in an assignment. 

    <input type="file" 
    
You can also use the <input> element to create a submit button. 
  
    <input type="submit" 
    
More on the submit button, you can make your submit button more fancy by using an image as the submit button. 

    <input type=Ã¯mage" 
    
To simply create a button that does not submit your data (maybe it can) but maybe you want to use this button for other things like to add to bookmark within a page. You can use the button element

    <button> 
    
### Labeling Your Form ### 
Now, you have the ability to make a text input, some yes or no options, a multiple answer form, and be able to submit. But none of that really matters because no one will know what the form is for, or what kind of data to use when inputting. That is why we label. You can use the `<labnll>` element to make labels around your input forms to let your user know what to enter. 

### Grouping ### 
How about making a form that asks for your name, address, and phone number. If you think that is creapy, you probably should remember when you filled out your information on Amazon. Now it does'nt sound as creapy? Well you can make forms that are bundled together using the `<fieldset>` element and the `<legend>` element. The <fieldset> where the forms will be at. The <legend> just like the name implies, gives you the idea of the form and it is a label regarding the form. 
  
# List, Tables, Forms # 

If you want your web page to hold data, then it might be a good idea to use a table. What I mean by data is some numbers or other characters you might want your users to see, to gian information with a data set. 
Simple ways to give out data, is like some of the ways I present notes onto here. Lists. You can bullet point style lists using your list-style-type property in CSS. After you create your list whether it is an unordered list or an ordered list, you can change how the buillets are presented. You can change the bullets with different characters defined in CSS, or you can use different ways to number, such as Roman numerals. 
IF you dont like the lists that are preinstalled, you can always use images. using the list-style-image attribute you can use images as your bullet points. 

Now that you got your list and customize bullet points, an important part of CSS still remains. That is positioning your lists. You can use the list-styles-position and use the values outside so that the bullet point will sit to the left of the block of text (default), or use the indide value which will set the marker inside of the box of text. 

It can look like this 

        |---------------------|
       * bullet point outside |
        |                     |
        |* bullet point inside|
        |                     | 
        
If list style position or type or image, is too long to type you can always go to the shorthand route. You just need to type in list-style and then set the property you want. 

### Table Properties ### 
There are a lot of different things that can go into tables, and in CSS there are ways to change those different things. 

* width 
* padding
* text-transform -convert the context of table to headers to uppercase 
* letter-spacing. font-size - to add aditional styling to content headers 
* border-top, border-bottom 
* text-align 
* background-color 
* :hover - change when a mouse goes over the element 

How about when you make a table but you need an empty spot in the table so you add a new table that is empty. You can do that, but there is another way. using the empty-cells attribute can make that happen for you. There are also some values that you can set with this attribute. 
 * show - will show the borders of any empty cell
 * hide - can hide the border of empty cells 
 * inherit - when you have a table nested in another, this value will inherit the properties of the parent 

There is also a way to make your table spaced out using the border-spacing property, and then you can make your table come together using the border-collapse property. 

# JS Events # 
Events are essentially things that will cause an action. Whether it is from a user hovering over an element in your page and that element changes color (interactive) or code that will make an even happen (triggered) or an event that will respond back to the user. All in all, there is a massive list of types of events. I will just list a few that is a peripheral event or mouse event just so you can get the idea. 

 * click
 *  dblclick 
 *  mousedown 
 *  mouseup
 *  mousemove
 *  mouseover
 *  mouseout 
 
So how do events work? Starting with the interaction, when a user interacts with the html, there will be some kind of trigger to JavScript code that will result in something else happening. 
1. the element is selected
2. identify which element will trigger the JavaScript event 
3. the code that will run that event
