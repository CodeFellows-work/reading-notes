# Custom Hooks 

### What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?

In React a component's lifecycle refers to the cycle of `Mounting` `Updation` and `unmounting` of components. The entire cycle is as follows: 

1. Initialization 
2. Mounting 
3. Updation
4. Unmounting

### Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect

You will need to use wrap functions in callbacks when called from within the useEffect so that you can avoid the use of a function again when the component re-renders. 

### Why are functional components preferred over class components?

Functional components are more prefferd over class components because they are easier to read and test. 

### What is wrong with the following code?


    import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

    function MyComponent(props) {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

      function changeCount(e) {
        setCount(e.target.value);
      }

      let renderedItems = []

      for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        useEffect( () => {
          console.log('component mount/update');
        }, [count]);

        renderedItems.push(<div key={i}>Item</div>);
      }

      return (<div>
         <input type='number' value={count} onChange={changeCount}/>
          {renderedItems}
        </div>);
    }
    
    
  The following code places the useEffect within a for loop causing a lifecycle event within each iteration. I believe this will break if it is left as is. 
  If you placed the for loop inside of the useEffect function, the code would probably run.

### state hook
A state hook like useState() will have a getter and a setter - which is like the state variable and then the state setter. 

      const [exampleState, setExampleState] = useState(); //<--------- no initial state value
      
### effect hook

  "By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API." - [soruce](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)
  
### reducer hook

Reducer hooks are like an alternative to useState or state. Using a reducer hook will help you manage the way state is changed through a series of switch statements. Reducer hooks will need to go through the action and a dispatcher to be able to set state.
