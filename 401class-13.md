### What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?

"Whereas HTTP relies on a client request to receive a response from the server for every exchange,
WebSockets allow for full-duplex bidirectional communication. This enables the server to send real-time updates
asynchronously, without requiring the client to submit a request each time. In the context of networked AV and control
systems, this allows devices to send and receive continuous streams of data to and from any point on the network." - [](https://www.amx.com/en/site_elements/benefits-and-applications-of-websockets#:~:text=BIDIRECTIONAL.,submit%20a%20request%20each%20time.)

### Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?

Socket.io will use HTTP to be able to serve its own client code.

### What happens when a client emits an event?

When a client emits an event, whatever has the same connection on the server or possibly another client will be listening for that emission.

### What happens when a server emits an event?

The same thing happens when emitting to the client. The listener will look for the same connection on whichever side the emit is coming from. 

### What happens if a client “misses” an event?

When a client misses an event, the data wont be reached to the client. 

### How can we mitigate this?

Proper handeling can mitigate this. 


## _Term_
### Socket

a client connection to the server.

### Web Socket

"The primary interface for connecting to a WebSocket server and then sending and receiving data on the connection." - [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)

### Socket.io

Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server. It consists of:

a Node.js server: Source | API
a Javascript client library for the browser (which can be also run from Node.js): Source | API

### Client

Relies on sending requests to the server to access data. 

### Server

Relies on requests made by the client or possibly another server to send data 

### OSI Model

"The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. The OSI model characterizes computing functions into a universal set of rules and requirements in order to support interoperability between different products and software." - [source](https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/osi-model)

### TCP Model

| TCP/IP |	OSI |
|---------|--------|
TCP refers to Transmission Control Protocol.	| OSI refers to Open Systems Interconnection. 
TCP/IP has 4 layers. |	OSI has 7 layers.
TCP/IP is more reliable	OSI is less reliable
TCP/IP does not have very strict boundaries.	OSI has strict boundaries
TCP/IP follow a horizontal approach.	OSI follows a vertical approach.
TCP/IP uses both session and presentation layer in the application layer itself.	OSI uses different session and presentation layers.
TCP/IP developed protocols then model.	OSI developed model then protocol.
Transport layer in TCP/IP does not provide assurance delivery of packets.	In OSI model, transport layer provides assurance delivery of packets.
TCP/IP model network layer only provides connection less services.	Connection less and connection oriented both services are provided by network layer in OSI model.
Protocols cannot be replaced easily in TCP/IP model.	While in OSI model, Protocols are better covered and is easy to replace with the change in technology.
