# What is stack? 

A stack is another type of data structure that includes nodes and is just like a singly node type meaning that each node will not reference the previous node inside of the stack.

Just like what is done on array, common things that are involved in stacks are `push` and `pop`. Other things that are used in a stack are `top` meaning the top of the stack, `peek` which will view the top node in the stack, and `isEmpty` which will return true when there is nothing in the stack. 

Stacks follow a concept of *FILO* which is First In and First Out just like function stacks. But Stacks will also have Last In and First Out or FILO. 

The image shown below is a visualization of `pop` from the stack as well as `push` into the stack, shows what the `top` is.

# What is Queue? 

Terminology that is commonly referred to when involving a *queue* is `Enqueue` which represends the nodes or items that will be added to the queue,
`dequeue` which are nodes or items removed from the queue, `Front` which represents the first node of the queue, `Rear` which represents the last node of the queue, `Peek` again which will let you view the first node or top or `front` of the queue, and lastly `isEmpty` which will return true if the queue is empty. 

Queues will also follow the concept of FILO and LIFO or First In and First Out, and Last In and First Out. 

The image below is a visual representation of what a *queue* looks like.
