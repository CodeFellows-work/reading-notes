# Java Basics

## Variables

First and foremost in Java, an object will store states in `fields`. 
Java will define these types of variables: 

1. Instance Variables 
2. Class Variables 
3. Local Variables 
4. Parameters 

We have to remember that in Java a variable name is case-senstive. It is convention to start the name with a letter and not a special character. Subsequent letters may be letters, numbers, and special characters but convention rules will apply. If the name is only one word, ensure that the word is in all lower-case. 

Java is statically typed, meaning that all variables must be declared before they are used. for example 
      
        int number = 1; 
        
This essentially will tell the program that the variable `number` is a integer. 
There are 8 primitive data types supported by Java. These are: 

1. byte  defaults to 0
2. short defaults to 0
3. int  defaults to 0 
4. long defaults to 0L 
5. float defaults to 0.0f
6. double defaults to 0.0d
7. boolean defaults to false
8. char '\u0000'

And than there is `string` which defualts to null

### Literals 
Literals are represented by the developers source code, unlike the primitive data types that are built into the language. 

### Operators 

Operator Precedence
Operators	Precedence
postfix	expr++ expr--
unary	++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !
multiplicative	* / %
additive	+ -
shift	<< >> >>>
relational	< > <= >= instanceof
equality	== !=
bitwise AND	&
bitwise exclusive OR	^
bitwise inclusive OR	|
logical AND	&&
logical OR	||
ternary	? :
assignment	= += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=

### Expressions

"An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value."

### Control Flow Statements 

These are statements that will "employ decision making" to your code. 

such as `if-then, if-then-else, switch, for, while, do-while, break, continue, return`

## What Does It Mean to Compile Code? 

To compile code, means to translate our higher-level language into the 1s and 0s the computer will be able to understand. We use higher level programming languages currently, because we still have humans writing our code - additionally writing machine language all the time can become very confusing.
