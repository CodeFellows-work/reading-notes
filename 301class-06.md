[Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

----------------------------------------------

### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming? ###
The six reasons for pair programming is: 
1. Greater efficiency 
2. Engaged Collaberation 
3. Learning from fellow students 
4. Social Skills 
5. Job Interview Readiness 
6. Work Environment Readiness 

### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial? ###
In my own experience there are a couple of these reasons I found to be very beneficial. The most beneficial in my opinion are number 3 or learning from other students - because you are looking at another perpective and it trains your thinking to see another approach to a problem. The other beneficial experience in my opinion is the Job interview readiness. I say this because with some team projects or collaberation under your belt, you can apply this onto your resume, as well as tell your hiring manager what your personal experiences were working with someone and how you collaberated in making decisions. 

### How does pair programming work? ### 
Pair programming is mostly when there are groups of 2 that will collaberate in findina solution with one person coding, and the other person minly thinking of the coding. This in my expereince is difficult at first, until you can eventaully think like your partner. This is when things can get efficient - especially if they are able to take your ideas and also incorperate some of their ideas along with the code.
