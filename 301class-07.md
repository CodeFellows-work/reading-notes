### Who is Roy Fielding? ### 
Roy Fielding is one of some people that collaberated and created the first web server. He dedicated a lot of his time researching why the web does what it does. 
### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? ###
Simply because it was not designed to do so. When created, the main purpose and goal was to be able to reach out to any machine - and not to talk to many. 
### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? ###
HTTP/1.1 
### What does a GET do? ###
GET is in charge of getting the resource that is needed from a server - in other words GET will retrieve what is requested. 
### What does a POST do? ###
POST is when you will send data to a server to update or change information. A good example of POST can be seen when you upload a profile pic.
### What does PUT do? ###
PUT is similar to POST where you send data to the server to update or change it, however PUT will return the same thing if you call it multiple times. 
### What does PATCH do? ### 
PATCH is also like POST and PUT, but more-so like POST because it is not idempotent. PATCH will also be a lot more limited when changing or updating data.
