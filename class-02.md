## HTML Text ## 
These notes will expand more on the elements used for HTML or the **markup** text that is used within HTML. To get started, there are two types of markup styles. 
* Structural Markup 
  Structural Markup is used to specify headings and paragraphs. These elements look like this `<h1> This is a heading </h1>` 
`<p> This is a paragraph </p>`
* Semantic Markup 
Semantic markup can be seen as something that is used in between those elements to give more detail or to emphasize something that might be within the content you are providing. We will go over the markup for that shortly. 

### Headings ### 
HTML uses a set of 6 headings with all different sizes `<h1>`being the largest and `<h6>`being the smallest.
