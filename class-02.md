## HTML Text ## 
These notes will expand more on the elements used for HTML or the **markup** text that is used within HTML. To get started, there are two types of markup styles. 
* Structural Markup 
  Structural Markup is used to specify headings and paragraphs. These elements look like this `<h1> This is a heading at its largest size </h1>` 
`<h6> This is a heading at its smallest size </h6>`
`<p> This is a paragraph </p>`
* Semantic Markup
