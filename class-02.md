## HTML Text ## 
These notes will expand more on the elements used for HTML or the **markup** text that is used within HTML. To get started, there are two types of markup styles. 
* Structural Markup 
  Structural Markup is used to specify headings and paragraphs. These elements look like this `<h1> This is a heading </h1>` 
`<p> This is a paragraph </p>`
* Semantic Markup 
Semantic markup can be seen as something that is used in between those elements to give more detail or to emphasize something that might be within the content you are providing. We will go over the markup for that shortly. 

### Headings ### 
HTML uses a set of 6 headings with all different sizes `<h1>`being the largest and `<h6>`being the smallest.

`<h1>` mainly used for the main headings while the rest of the headings are more for subheadings. A paragraph element will contain one or more sentences, and a start of a pragraph will always start on a new line. This is a paragraph tag: `<p> </p>`. 
What we covered so far are some structural markups. The headers and the subheaders, as well as the paragraphs which form sentences on new line (everytime a pragraph tag is used). 

### Bold and Italic ### 
To make words appear in **bold** lettering, in HTML you use the `<b>` element to wrap around the word that you want to make bold. This is an example of a *semantic* markup. 
To make words appear *italicized*, in HTML you use the `<i>` element to wrap around the word that you want to make italic. This is another example of a *semantic* markup. 

### Superscript and Subscript ### 
Let's say you want to include a math equation and it includes an exponent. The **superscript** or the `<sup>` element is the go to. For instance if you wanted an output for "x squared" your code will look like 
 
      <p> The formula includes x<sup>2</sup></p> 
This can also work for dates. 

Let's say you wanted to use CO2 for a chemestry assignment. This would call for a **Subscript** or `<sub>`. The code for the proper way to write CO2 would look like this: 

      <p> There is too much CO<sub>2</sub></p>
