### How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?

Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS is different from React, because vanilla JS/HTML/CSS does not use a library and there is more control over what is created. React, is a library that will use reusable code within components to break down the UI into smaller bits. Overall, for larger applications it is better to use React as opposed to vanilla JS, because of how complicated it can become when using vanilla JS. 

### What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?

Functional components is essentially just JavaScript functions that will return React elements. Class components requires an `extends` from React, to render React elements. Other than being functions or classes to return React elements, another big difference between functional and class components is how lifecycle methods are used. Class components will have access to them such as the `componentDidMount()`, but functional components will not have access to these lifecycle methods - and therefore hooks are used instead. 

### _Term_

JavaScript/ES6 functions that will return React elements known as JSX.
