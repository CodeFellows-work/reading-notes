# Event Driven Applications
### Why is access control important?

Access control is as important as it is because it essentially blocks unauthorized access to information that could be potentially very important. "When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach. They apply anywhere access is required to perform a business activity and should be adhered to when accessing information in any format, on any device." - [Source](https://www.inform-consult.com/why-is-access-control-important/)

### Describe an application that would need access control.

An example of an application that will need access control can be your banking application. Now that money is involved (especially your money) you now understand the importance of access control. You would never want someone you have not given permission to - access your banking information. That is why there is things like basic authentication with the addition of two-factor authentication in some cases. If you still do not understand the importance of access control, I urge you to comment your banking information so that I may access it. 

### What is a role used for?

Role is used to determine the previledges of a user that will acess an application. Whether the user will be granted permission to just read the information, read and write information, read, write, and update the information and finally read, write, update, and delete information. Think of your operating system and how a guest account may differentiate with your main account. 

### Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
"Role Based Access Control (RBAC), also known as Non discretionary Access Control, takes more of a real world approach to structuring access control. Access under RBAC is based on a user's job function within the organization to which the computer system belongs." - [Source](https://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Mandatory,_Discretionary,_Role_and_Rule_Based_Access_Control) 

With that, role based access control is more scalable because roles can easily change, and it is easy to change when using a role based system.
