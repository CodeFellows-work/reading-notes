### Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)

A singleton in terms of computer science is a class "that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance." - [source](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/15830/singleton). 
You might want to use this when you want to restrict "instantiation of a class to only one object. This is helpful usually when a single object is required to coordinate actions across a system." - [source](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/15830/singleton). It is declared globally and provides a global point of access. 

### Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes

You can use the singleton pattern within a node module so that you do not have to use the `new` keyword. 

[source](https://grokonez.com/node-js/how-to-implement-singleton-in-node-js-example)

Here we have an example of how a singleton is used in nodes. 

          
        let cash = 0;

        const Bank = {
            deposit(amount) {
                cash += amount;
                return cash;
            },
            withdraw(amount) {
                if (amount <= cash) {
                    cash -= amount;
                    return true;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            },
            total() {
                return cash;
            }
        }

        module.exports = Bank;
        
In this example *Bank* is used like a singleton when we use the `module.exports` 

### If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?

when constructing something such as Express middleware without actually using Express - something I think about using is a linked list. The reason is because it operates very similarly to Express middleware due to the fact that it references the next node, just like Express middleware will use the `next` keyword to move on to the next function. 

## _Terms_ 
### Router Middleware
"functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle." - [source](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html).

### Dynamic Module Loading
"A module loader allows you to invoke pieces of code dynamically at run-time. Configurations of what gets executed when can be defined in a database, statically, where ever. What’s important is that we’ll reference our modules by name (using a string), have them loaded dynamically and then executed." - [source](http://tuttlem.github.io/2016/01/21/dynamic-module-loading-in-python.html).

### Singleton Pattern
As mentioned above, a singleton pattern is a class that allows a single instance of itself to be created, and also gives access to the created instance. 

### CRUD -> REST Method Matches

POST -> Create 
GET -> Read
PUT -> Update/Replace 
Patch -> Update/Modify 
Delete -> Delete

### Mock Testing
"Mock testing is an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules. In mock testing, the dependencies are replaced with objects that simulate the behaviour of the real ones. The purpose of mocking is to isolate and focus on the code being tested and not on the behaviour or state of external dependencies." - [source](https://devopedia.org/mock-testing).


### _Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?_
  1. CRUD 
  2. REST 
  3. Middleware
### _Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?_
  1. Singleton Pattern
  2. Middleware 
  3. Dynamic Module Loading
### _What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?_
I am excited to learn more about singleton patterns and how it ultimatley works when I personally code it.
