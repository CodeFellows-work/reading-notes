# Hooks API

1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

We do not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app, because React will utilize the DOM and rerender DOM with the components you set.

2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?

> Outside the <BrowserRouter/>
> Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />
> Inside a <Route />

I think that to have a component render on every page, we should place the component `inside` the `<BrowserRouter />` and outside of the `<Route/>` because the route will point you to the a component that you set it to, and is individual.  

3. What does props.children contain?

Props.children will contain everything in between the tags you place them in.

### Composition
A common composition pattern in JavaScript is using object composition. It combines the power of objects and functional programming. For the example above, imagine an animal has the ability to eat and fly. In hierarchy, that could mean to have an Animal and FlyingAnimal. And if we add more and more animals, that hierarchy could become a bit messy, since abilities are shared between animals.

With composition, you could have factories that create an object:

      const alligator = name => {
        const self = {
          name
        };

        return self;
      }

      const jack =  alligator("jack");

### Children / Child Components
Child components allow you to pass a component as a prop to other components. 
### Hash Routing
"What we meant by hash-based routing is using the anchor part of the URL to simulate different content. For example http://site.com/#/products/list leads to displaying a list of products. We have to mention that the #/products/list bit is never sent to the server. and we are completely operating in the client-side. The routing is possible because changes in the hash donâ€™t trigger page reload." Source = [Source](https://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/deep-dive-into-client-side-routing-navigo-pushstate-hash)
### Link Routing
Link routing will provide you with "declarative, accessible navigation around your application" Source = [Source](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Link)
