# AWS: S3 and Lambda
### Describe “The Cloud”

Clouds are essentially servers that are placed all over the world and many software and databases are connected to them. When Using a cloud service, it is very convenient because you will not have to manage the physical servers themselves - It is the datacenters responsibility. 

### What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

A container can be looked at as software that will pack up all of the code you have written and its dependencies, so that applications can run more efficiently and reliably on an environment. 

### What is auto-scaling?

"Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost." - [Source AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/)

### What is bandwidth?

'Bandwidth is measured as the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another within a network in a specific amount of time. Typically, bandwidth is expressed as a bitrate and measured in bits per second (bps)." - [Source Bandwidth](https://www.paessler.com/it-explained/bandwidth)

### How do cloud providers compute service costs?

"When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud." - [Source Cost](https://expedient.com/knowledgebase/blog/2015-05-01-how-the-cost-of-cloud-computing-is-calculated/)

## _Term_
### Server Instances
A server instance is a virtual machine or machines that will run workloads in the cloud.

### Containers

Containers will pack up all the code and its dependencies just like a zip file, so that the application that uses the containers will run more efficiently.

### Cloud Services

Cloud services are a collection of servers that can be ina database center all over the world that will provide server services to you. This can make things convenient. 

### Cloud Architecture

"Cloud Architecture refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems. Cloud architecture defines the components as well as the relationships between them." 

"The various components of Cloud Architecture are:

On premise resources
Cloud resources
Software components and services
Middleware"

### AWS

AWS or Amazon Web Services is a cloud platform that offers a wide variety of products and services to use. 

### EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku

EC2 - "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment." - [Source AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?ec2-whats-new.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&ec2-whats-new.sort-order=desc)

Beanstalk - "AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS." - [Source AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)

Heroku - "Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud." - [Source Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

When comparing the AWS products with Heroku, it seems that the services from AWS give developers more power to control how they create their environemnts where as Heroku is a one size fits all service.
