### In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:
100’s = *Informational status codes* 
200’s = *Success status codes request accepted*
300’s = *Redirection Status codes resource not available at location* 
400’s = *Client error codes* 
500’s = *Server error codes* 
### What is a status code 202?

## What does a 500 error status code mean?
Status code 500 is an internal server error. 
## What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?
Status code 200 is good and 'ok'. Status code 201 will go to the backend side and signal creation for the resource and return with the header resources.
