[What is OAuth?](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3216404/what-is-oauth-how-the-open-authorization-framework-works.html)

### What is OAuth? ###

OAuth is a "open-standard authorization protocol" that is also known as a thirdy-party authorization. Essentially, with tools like these a user is able to provide a single sign on credential and not worry so much about the strength of the password - although it is always good practice to have strong passwords. This is becasue the tool will use the data of your sign on to pass on authentication to the assets you will be accessing, without the assets knowing your single sign on. 

### Give an example of what using OAuth would look like. ###

An example of OAuth being utilized is when you visit a website, and it gives you the option to sign into their system using your other accoundts they can link the services logon with. 

### How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user? ###

1. firstly, the first website will connect to teh second website on the users behalf using OAuth. 
2. the second web site will generate some kind of one-time-token and a one-time-secret token to the involved parties of this entire transaction. 
3. the first page will take the secret and regular token to the client 
4. the client will present the two tokens to the provider 
5. If there is authentication required, the client will ask the provider for authentication to approve the transaction to the second site. 
6. user approves 
7. The user is given approved access tokens 
8. then the user will give those tokens to the first web site 
9. then the access tokens will be taken to the second web site 
10. the second website will allow the first website access 
11. the user can see the transaction occuring 

### What is OpenID? ### 

OpenID is a way for humans to log into machines. OpenID is an authenticator and not a authorizor. 

[Authorization and Authentication flows](https://auth0.com/docs/flows)

### What is the difference between authorization and authentication? ###

The difference between authorization and authentication, can be simplified by determiing who are what is logging into another service or device. For instance, when humans log into the computer, the computer will ask for a password or something letting the computer know that it is you that is logging in. So the computer needs 
*authentication* in order for the user to access the computer. From there, if the user wants to access a service, lets say a web page of some sort. From there the user will be able to log in with OAuth which the comoputer will try to log into other services on the users behalf. So it is like the computer logging in to another service. For the computers to achieve this, they will require authorization.   

### What is Authorization Code Flow? ###

Authorization code flow is the exchange of code for tokens. 

### What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)? ###

To create a secure way for the excahnge of tokens and bits of code, the authentication will be taken through a difficult path - going through code challenges and barriers before authorization - and once it reaches this, there will be another code verifier and challenge before the access token can be finally reached. This level of security was implemented due to the several opportunities for malicious behavior to enter with just plain code and token exchange.   

### What is Implicit Flow with Form Post? ###

Implicit Flow is an alternative method for fetching the required tokens for access. This method will prevent the need to worry about "securely storing client secrets." 

### What is Client Credentials Flow? ###

services running in the backend and authenticatng and authorizing the app rather than the user can sometimes pose a problem. To allieviate this, you can use the Client Credentials Flow. This will utlize the M2M apps or machine to machine apps, to pass along the Client ID and Client secret for the user to get the token themselves. 

### What is Device Authorization Flow? ###

The device authorization flow is used for devices which is designed to counter the problem of some devices that "do not have an easy way to enter text" the device app will use the authentication flow and they padd the clinet ID to initiate the authorization process. 

### What is Resource Owner Password Flow? ### 

It is recommended that "highly-trusted aookucatuib can use the Resource Owner Password Flow' . This is will request user credentials through something like a form. Becuase the credentials are sent towards the backend that is stored before the exchange of access tokens.
