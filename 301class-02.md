# State and Props # 
## Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’? ##
Based off the drawing in this [article](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093), it seems that the render occurs before the `componentDidMount` within one of the three phases called `mounting`. The three phases 
  1. Mounting 
  2. Updating 
  3. Unmounting 

## What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React? ## 
In React the very first thing that will happen in the lifecycle is the `getDerivedStateFromProps` then `render`, `componentDidMount` and `UNSAFE_ComponentWillMount`.  This is all occuring in the `Mounting` phase and occurs in the order that I listed. 

## Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates ## 

In this order will the following thing occur: 
  1. the very first thing that will occur even before the first phase is the **constructor** 
  2. **Render** 
  3. **ComponentDidMount** 
  4. React updates 
  5. **ComponentsWillUnmount** 

## What does componentDidMount do? ## 

The `componentDidMount` again, is a method that is invoked immediatley after a component is mounted, and it will essentially load anying requiring a networking request or anything that initilizes the DOM. For instance you will use this method to connect to Youtube API's. 

## What types of things can you pass in the props? ## 
Props that you pass through can be anything from integers, strings, objects, functions, or Arrays. 
## What is the big difference between props and state? ##
**Props** are like arguments to a function. You pass Props to components where components are like functions. Props are also something that you cannot change over time. **State** however, does change over time, and is for a specific part of a component. 
## When do we re-render our application? ## 
When you change the state inside a application it will re-render the entire application. 
## What are some examples of things that we could store in state? ##
Because state is used for when you need to re-render and have updates made on your application the things you store in state are based on what the user has done.
