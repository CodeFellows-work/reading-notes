### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
**Test Driven Development** or _TDD_ is a practice that developers often engage in to create a fine tuned and well functioning product. TDD is essentially when developers test their code, before they build the code. 

### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
One case you may want to use `beforeEach()` or `afterEach()` in a test suite is when you need a method that needs to be called before a test or after a test. 
[Jest Documents](https://jestjs.io/docs/setup-teardown)

### What is one downside of Test Driven Development
One downside of TDD is that the tests are harder to write because the code is more complex. "The tests are hard to write because the code is more complex to write and understand. - [source](https://www.fleekitsolutions.com/bdd-vs-tdd-pros-cons/)

### Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
The primary difference between ES6 classes and Constuctor/Prototype classes is that ES6 classes "defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance" -[source](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/es6-class-chaos-keeps-js-developer-up)

### Why REST?
Rest is used to minimize the coupeling between the client and the server components in a distributed application. It can be difficult to achieve the same low leveled coupeling without following all of the constraints of REST.

### _Terms_
**functional programming**
"Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects." - [Functional Programming](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0)


**object-oriented programming (OOP)**
"Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects." - [OOP](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming)


**class**
A Class is a template for creating Objects in JavaScript. 


**super**
the keywork `super` is used to access call functions on an object's parent - [super](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super)


**this**
The contextual `this` references the object in 'non-strict mode' and can reference any value in 'strict mode'


**Test Driven Development (TDD)**
A practice that developers often engage in to create a fine tuned and well functioning product


**Jest**
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework. [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)


**Continuous Integration (CI)**
"Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project." - [CI](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration)


**REST**
_Representational State Transfer** architectural style that handles the client-server relationship_


**Data Model**
"Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of either a whole information system or parts of it to communicate connections between data points and structures." - [Data Modeling](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/data-modeling)


_Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
1. Jest 
2. REST
3. Data Modeling 
_Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
1. Jest 
2. REST 
3. Data Modeling
_What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?_
When there is an assignment that has to do with REST, I am just happy I got it working. I feel the same with writing tests on Jest.
