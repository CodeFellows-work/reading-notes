### What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

The benifit to transforming data into packets is to be cost-effective, efficient, and scalable. It is better than transferring large blocks of data. 

### UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?

"Connectionless protocols, in contrast, allow data to be exchanged without setting up a link between processes. Each unit of data, with all the necessary information to route it to the intended destination, is transferred independent of other data packets and can travel over different paths to reach the final destination. Some data packets might be lost in transmission or might arrive out of sequence to other data packets.
UDP is a connectionless protocol. It is known as a datagram protocol because it is analogous to sending a letter where you don't acknowledge receipt." -[Source](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19620-01/805-4041/6j3r8iu2f/index.html#:~:text=UDP%20is%20a%20connectionless%20protocol,services%20are%20broadcasting%20and%20tftp%20.)

### Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?

Connections on the same socket server is allowed just as long as the connections are associated with different things client-side. 

### Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?

Multiple connections on the server can connect to the same socket server. 

### Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

Applications can be connected both ways from server to connection and connection to server, just as long as there is a connection. 

## _Term_
### Observer Pattern
"Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically. Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category." - [Source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/observer_pattern.htm)
### Listener
"A listener is a procedure or function in a computer program that waits for an event to occur." - [Source](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/e/event-listener.htm)
### Event Handler
An event handler takes care of an event when the event occurs. 
### Event Driven Programming
Event driven proghramming uses events to develop software. From a smaller scale, pressing a button to which causes an event to occur and then it is handled; even driven programming is like multiple buttons being pressed (but the button is replaced with some other code). 
### Event Loop
The event loop involves a call stack and an event queue. "The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call is processed." - [Source](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-an-event-loop-in-javascript)
### Event Queue
The event queue is responsible for sending new functions for processing. It follows the queue data structure for orderly operations. 
### Call Stack
The call stack is responsible for tracking all of the operations in line to be executed. 
### Emit/Raise/Trigger
Emit will listen to an event and fires a callback when it is emitted. 

Raise is an error

Trigger is what occurs when an event is hit 
### Subscribe
You subscribe to events which will define a callback when the event is fired. 
### database
A collection of data.
