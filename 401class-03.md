# Express REST API #

## Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
* A case where we might want to change a request with custom middleware can be when we need error handling. 
* Another case where we might want to use middleware is to authenticate or authorize users when not using third-party authentication services.
* A more general case is just for the security of your application, and reusability of your code. 

## True or false: The route handler is middleware?
False. 

## In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
A way that middleware function can end the process and send data to the browser is through error handling.
Another way is the opposite, it can end a process of if there happens to be a successful request. 

## At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
Middleware is used once a request has been made and before it is recieved. 

## What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”
"If getUserById throws an error or rejects, next will be called with either the thrown error or the rejected value. If no rejected value is provided, next will be called with a default Error object provided by the Express router." - [Middleware Error Handling](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html)

## Terms ## 
### Middleware
"Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next." - [Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)

### Request Object
`Request()` creates a new request object
[Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)

### Response Object
`Response()` creates a new response object. 
[Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response)

### Application Middleware
"Bind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the app.use() and app.METHOD() functions, where METHOD is the HTTP method of the request that the middleware function handles (such as GET, PUT, or POST) in lowercase." - [Application-Level Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html#middleware.application)

### Routing Middleware
"Router-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of express.Router()." = [Router-level Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html#middleware.router)

### Test Driven Development
TDD or Test Driven Development is the practice of testing code before building. 

### Behavioral Testing
"means creating an executable specification that fails because the feature doesn't exist, then writing the simplest code that can make the spec pass. You repeat this until a release candidate is ready to ship." - [BDD](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/tdd-vs-bdd)

### _Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?_
1. TDD 
2. Middleware
3. Application Middleware

### _Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?_
1. Application Middleware
2. Router-level middleware
3. BDD 
### _What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?_
I am excited to work more with Middleware in general, as this can be a method to clean up code.
